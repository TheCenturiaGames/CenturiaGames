      <h2>🎓 Our Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Founded during the 2024–2025 UPC Master's programs in Advanced Programming and Animation & Digital Arts for AAA
        Games, Centuria Games is an independent studio based in Barcelona. We are the creative team behind The Hound of
        Ulster, an action game inspired by Celtic myths. From environmental design to animation and shader work, every
        detail has been carefully designed by our creatives. To bring our vision to life, we created our own custom
        engine: the Sobrassada Engine. Built entirely from the ground up by our dedicated programmers, it empowers our
        artists to experiment all the cool, quirky, and stylized ideas they imagined.

      <h2>🕹️ The Game</h2>
      <p>
        Take the role of <strong>Cu Chulainn</strong> and embark on a legendary quest to recover the <strong>Bull of
        Cooley</strong>. Inspired by Celtic myths, The Hound of Ulster blends fast-paced, responsive combat with a
        striking, stylized world full of gods, warriors, and old magic. Battle fierce enemies, explore ancient stories,
        and carve your own path through a myth where every move feels meaningful — and every fight tells part of the
        tale.
